Each new branch for dz must be done with master

After you've finished doing your homework on your branch, you need to make a pull request (PR). Then add a mentor to review the code. Only after the mentor approves the PR, you can merge the branch with the master's homework.

Read the mentor's comments carefully. Correct the comments and commit to the homework branch. Changes will be pulled into PR automatically after you submit a commit with fixes to github. After fixing, add the mentor again to the code review.
